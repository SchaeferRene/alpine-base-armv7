# docker-env
## About
`docker-env` is my personal playground to create Docker images for different architectures. It has been tested with:

* armv7h (Odroid-XU4)
* x86_64 (Schenker XMG)


## Whats in it?
* Script to create alpine based docker base image from scratch
* build nginx image on top of base image
